# PKMN Framework [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Justis-Lamanna/pkmn-framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Justis-Lamanna/pkmn-framework)

A rudimentary framework for dealing with HEX files in an easier manner. 

* Allow easy parsing of complex objects using annotations and reflection, rather than reading the hex byte-by-byte. 
* Allow easy parsing and injecting of ini files
* Image manipulation
* Maybe other stuff probably over time.

End goal is to make a library that allows a programmer to pick up and start developing tools for ROM hacking, without
having to worry about rewriting a framework for reading bytes and parsing out objects each time.

Intended to be lightweight. Uses only apache commons (Lang) as a 3rd-party library.
